# Practice Repository

This repository is for my learning and practice with **Git, GitHub, and basic programming concepts**.  
It also includes exercises in **JavaScript fundamentals** as preparation for learning **React** and **TypeScript**.

## Purpose
- Practice version control with Git  
- Learn GitHub workflows (commit, push, branches, etc.)  
- Explore JavaScript basics (variables, functions, objects, etc.)  
- Build a foundation for React and TypeScript  

## Notes
This is not a production project â€” just a personal learning space. ðŸš€
